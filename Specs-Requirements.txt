1.	Introduction

1.1	Purpose 
//The Graphical User Interface for the Dotson Lab Alaska Water Sewage Challenge acts as a way for a homeowner to interact with the 
Alaska Water Sewage Challenge project that is being created in Dotson Lab. The User Interface for the Dotson Lab Alaska Water Sewage 
Challenge is hereafter refered to as "Interface". The Dotson Lab Alaska Water Sewage Challenge is hereafter refered to as 
"water/wastewater system". The Interface will:
  (a) Maintain Serial Communication and Control
  (b) Datalogging and Modeling
  (c) Display features
  (d) Produce good data (Consulting)
  
  //INSERT PARAGRAPH ABOUT EACH INDIVIDUAL FEATURE HERE?
  
Identify the product whose software requirements are specified in this document, including the revision or release number. 
Describe the scope of the product that is covered by this SRS, particularly if this SRS describes only part of the system 
or a single subsystem.>

1.2	Document Conventions
<
  //Unknown

Describe any standards or typographical conventions that were followed when writing this SRS, such as fonts or 
highlighting that have special significance. For example, state whether priorities  for higher-level requirements are 
assumed to be inherited by detailed requirements, or whether every requirement statement is to have its own priority.>

1.3	Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions
//This document is for the developers and Dotson Lab hereaftere "the user".
  The developers will be able to determine how to meet the requirements from this document. The user will be able to determine
  what to expect they can do with this product and how it works to meet their needs.
  
  The document is orgainzed in the following order: introductory infomrmation, product creation, external interactions, product
  features, and non-functional requirements.

  //What is most useful for us developers to refer back to? For the user?
  
Describe the different types of reader that the document is intended for, such as developers, project managers, marketing 
staff, users, testers, and documentation writers. Describe what the rest of this SRS contains and how it is organized. 
Suggest a sequence for reading the document, beginning with the overview sections and proceeding through the sections 
that are most pertinent to each reader type.>

1.4	Product Scope
//The Interface will connect the user to the control and monitering arduino chip in the water/wastewater system. 
From this arduino chip the Interface will allow a user to view water levels and flow as well as if the water/wastewater system needs 
to be emptied. The Interface will allow monitoring and data logging to users. It also acts so that users do not need to press 
mechanical buttons to manage the system. The data logging feature is specifically designed for research purposes of the user.


1.5	References
<
  //Unknown

List any ther documents or Web addresses to which this SRS refers. These may include user interface style guides, 
contracts, standards, system requirements specifications, use case documents, or a vision and scope document. Provide 
enough information so that the reader could access a copy of each reference, including title, author, version number, 
date, and source or location.>

2.	Overall Description
2.1	Product Perspective
//The Interface is to be used with the water/wastewater system. It is to read information from the Arduino chip that will control and monitor the system on a hardware level. The interface will be constructed on a touchscreen interface attached to a raspberry pi board.

  //anything else it connects to/interactions?

Describe the context and origin of the product being specified in this SRS. For example, state whether this product is 
a follow-on member of a product family, a replacement for certain existing systems, or a new, self-contained product. If 
the SRS defines a component of a larger system, relate the requirements of the larger system to the functionality of this 
software and identify interfaces between the two. A simple diagram that shows the major components of the overall system, 
subsystem interconnections, and external interfaces can be helpful.>

2.2	Product Functions
<
  //Bullet list of features. I think this is in intro too.
  (a) Maintain Serial Communication and Control
      This is needed so that the Interface can present and store data.
  (b) Datalogging and Modeling
      This is a requirement for the user who may have other research uses for previous data.
      The datalogs will be accessable through an SD card provided by the user.
      This also will alow data to be presented in a readable format to the reader.
  (c) Display features
      This will allow users to interact and read the data on the touch screen device.
      This will include determining what information to show by selecting a user type.
  (d) Produce good data (Consulting)
      This will be achieved through consulting for the client as the code on the Arduino the Interface reads from will
      be corrected as needed.

Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user perform. Details will be provided in 
Section 3, so only a high level summary (such as a bullet list) is needed here. Organize the functions to make them 
understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of related requirements and how they relate, 
such as a top level data flow diagram or object class diagram, is often effective.>

2.3	User Classes and Characteristics
<
  //there is a "homeowner" and "advanced homeowner" as well as our research group users. Most important may need to be changed.
  
  There are three classes of users that will use the Interface. These users will be refered to as "basic user", "advanced user",
  and "research user".
  
  Basic User Needs:
    (1) Notification of when to empty waste
    (2) Notification when there is a problem identified
  Advanced User Needs:
    (1) All Basic User Needs
    (2) Display of all water levels measured in system
    (3) Display of all valve positions in system
    (4) Display of pressures measured in system
    (5) Display of power to components
    (6) Button sequence
    (7) Clear annoations (?)
  Research User Needs:
    (1) All Basic User Needs
    (2) Datalogging of measured data in text files
    (3) Consulting on code written for system
    
  For the purposes of this document the basic user needs are of the highest importance as all other user needs include those of the
  basic user.

Identify the various user classes that you anticipate will use this product. User classes may be differentiated based 
on frequency of use, subset of product functions used, technical expertise, security or privilege levels, educational 
level, or experience. Describe the pertinent characteristics of each user class. Certain requirements may pertain only 
to certain user classes. Distinguish the most important user classes for this product from those who are less important 
to satisfy.>

2.4	Operating Environment
<
  //define that touchscreen, raspberry pi, image loaded (raspian?), interaction with arduino code written by client

Describe the environment in which the software will operate, including the hardware platform, operating system and 
versions, and any other software components or applications with which it must peacefully coexist.>

2.5	Design and Implementation Constraints
<
  //issues include unknown code interactions, working in parallel with water/wastewater system that is still in design
  //must interact with arduino
  //connected via cord as given
  //memory to sd card
  //NO DATABASES as per client request
  //Server available
  //this allows client to maintain software as needed
  //client side will need modification as per request of client (consulting)

Describe any items or issues that will limit the options available to the developers. These might include: corporate or 
regulatory policies; hardware limitations (timing requirements, memory requirements); interfaces to other applications; 
specific technologies, tools, and databases to be used; parallel operations; language requirements; communications 
protocols; security considerations; design conventions or programming standards (for example, if the customer’s 
organization will be responsible for maintaining the delivered software).>

2.6	User Documentation
<
  //user manuals?? We didn't ask if they wanted this, but probably should have
  //comments in code
  //minimum readme files for user

List the user documentation components (such as user manuals, on-line help, and tutorials) that will be delivered along 
with the software. Identify any known user documentation delivery formats or standards.>

2.7	Assumptions and Dependencies
<
  //assumed time constraint on advising client per week
  //assumed the interface takes priority
  //assumed data read in is good

List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the requirements stated in the SRS. These could 
include third-party or commercial components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating environment, 
or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify 
any dependencies the project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to reuse from another 
project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).>

3.	External Interface Requirements

3.1	User Interfaces
<
  //What kind of gui? It must fit in the touchscreen, what are its demensions?
  //What kind of buttons? Should there be a help? We already know we need a "normal" and "advanced" button
  //Data needing to be displayed and modeled:
  Under Basic User Tab:
    (1) Notification of when to empty waste
    (2) Notification when there is a problem identified
  Under Advanced User Tab:

    (3) Display of all valve positions in system
    (4) Display of pressures measured in system
    (5) Display of power to components
    (6) Button sequence
    (7) Clear annoations (?)

Describe the logical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the users. This may include 
sample screen images, any GUI standards or product family style guides that are to be followed, screen layout constraints, 
standard buttons and functions (e.g., help) that will appear on every screen, keyboard shortcuts, error message display 
standards, and so on. Define the software components for which a user interface is needed. Details of the user interface 
design should be documented in a separate user interface specification.>

3.2	Hardware Interfaces
<
  //how are we communicating with the arduino? what language are we using? what languages are supported by our hardware?
  The touchscreen device is connected to the raspberry pi board that acts as the Interface. The interface is connect by cord (ethernet?)
  to the Arduino chip in the water/wastewater system.

Describe the logical and physical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the hardware 
components of the system. This may include the supported device types, the nature of the data and control interactions 
between the software and the hardware, and communication protocols to be used.>

3.3	Software Interfaces
<
  //How is it interacting with the software written on the Arduino? Read/Write? What kind of data? What is the purpose?

Describe the connections between this product and other specific software components (name and version), including 
databases, operating systems, tools, libraries, and integrated commercial components. Identify the data items or messages 
coming into the system and going out and describe the purpose of each. Describe the services needed and the nature of 
communications. Refer to documents that describe detailed application programming interface protocols. Identify data that 
will be shared across software components. If the data sharing mechanism must be implemented in a specific way 
(for example, use of a global data area in a multitasking operating system), specify this as an implementation constraint.>

3.4	Communications Interfaces
<
  //There aren't any communication interfaces, or at least not that I'm aware of.

Describe the requirements associated with any communications functions required by this product, including e-mail, 
web browser, network server communications protocols, electronic forms, and so on. Define any pertinent message 
formatting. Identify any communication standards that will be used, such as FTP or HTTP. Specify any communication 
security or encryption issues, data transfer rates, and synchronization mechanisms.>

4.	System Features
<
  //we can basically organize this how we want. probably by features for us.

This template illustrates organizing the functional requirements for the product by system features, the major services 
provided by the product. You may prefer to organize this section by use case, mode of operation, user class, object 
class, functional hierarchy, or combinations of these, whatever makes the most logical sense for your product.>
